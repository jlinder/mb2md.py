# mb2md.py

A script that converts mbox files to maildir folders.

This version has been updated to use python 3. The source is from the [patched v0.2 version made by Jon Schewe](https://github.com/jpschewe/admin-scripts/blob/master/mb2md.py) (specifically, [this commit from 2008](https://github.com/jpschewe/admin-scripts/commit/bb9662b96948cc4a6fe4c6405fd06a7921d83c93)). Jon's version appears that it was based on the script [this mailing list post](https://dovecot.org/list/dovecot/2008-March/029736.html) presented but which is no longer at the specified link.

I used this with Python 3.7 to convert mbox files generated by exporting folders from Mac Mail on Mojave into maildir folders.
